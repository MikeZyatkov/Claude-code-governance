# Claude Code Governance Framework - Roadmap

## Vision

Transform software development from interrupt-driven to autonomous: developers create implementation plans, approve them, and AI agents execute all tasks with guaranteed pattern compliance. Developers review once at the end, freeing 75-90 minutes per feature for strategic work.

**Core Value:** Enable 10x developer productivity while ensuring consistent architecture quality across the organization.

---

## Current State

**Built:**
- ✅ 12 architecture patterns (DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing, etc.)
- ✅ LLM-as-judge evaluation framework
- ✅ Pattern calibration rubrics
- ✅ Pattern validation scripts
- ✅ Implementation plan context support

**Capability:** Can evaluate code after it's written and score pattern compliance.

**Limitation:** Developers must manually review and fix pattern violations every 10-15 minutes during implementation.

---

## Strategic Phases

### Phase 1: Benchmarks - Validation & Trust
**Timeline:** 2 weeks

**What:** Comprehensive test suite proving evaluation framework scores patterns accurately.

**Why:** Can't trust autonomous correction without knowing evaluation is accurate. Benchmarks provide instant feedback (30 seconds) vs waiting weeks for real-world validation.

**Business Value:**
- Confidence in pattern scoring
- Fast iteration on pattern improvements (test v1 vs v2 in minutes)
- Foundation for autonomous capabilities
- Regression detection (catch breaking changes before deployment)

**Success Metrics:**
- 15+ benchmark fixtures across 3+ patterns
- Version comparison working
- CI/CD detecting regressions
- Team confidence: "We trust these scores"

---

### Phase 2: Plugin Foundation - Distribution & Integration
**Timeline:** 3 weeks

**What:** Package framework as Claude Code plugin with pattern injection, evaluation, and auto-correction hooks.

**Why:** Native integration enables autonomous workflows. One command installation for entire team. Hooks inject patterns before generation, evaluate after, and auto-correct violations.

**Business Value:**
- Seamless team adoption (one command install)
- Pattern enforcement during code generation (not just after)
- Automatic violation correction (70%+ success rate)
- Native Claude Code experience

**Key Features:**
- **Pattern Injection Hook:** Patterns automatically added to context before code generation
- **Evaluation Hook:** Pattern scores displayed immediately after generation
- **Auto-Correction Hook:** Self-improving loop fixes violations automatically
- **Slash Commands:** `/evaluate-code`, `/pattern-gaps`, `/validate-all`

**Success Metrics:**
- Plugin installs cleanly
- Pattern injection works (verified manually)
- Evaluation displays scores
- Auto-correction improves benchmark fixtures
- Ready for pilot

---

### Phase 3: Autonomous Implementation - Self-Improving Loop
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks pilot + ongoing refinement

**What:** Autonomous agents execute complete implementation plans with self-correction, escalating only when unable to meet standards.

**Why:** Free developers from 10-15 minute review cycles. Enable 1-1.5 hours of uninterrupted deep work per feature. Maintain guaranteed pattern compliance.

**Business Value:**
- **75-90 minutes saved per feature** - Developers freed for strategic work
- **Consistent quality** - Guaranteed 4.0+ pattern scores
- **Faster delivery** - Features ship 30-40% faster
- **Reduced technical debt** - Pattern violations caught immediately

**Autonomous Loop:**
```
1. Generate code following patterns
2. Self-evaluate against benchmarks
3. If score < 4.0:
   → Analyze issues
   → Generate correction plan
   → Fix and re-evaluate
   → Repeat (max 3 attempts)
4. Verify requirements met
5. Ready for human review (once at end)
```

**Success Metrics:**
- 70%+ autonomous success rate
- 60+ minutes saved per feature
- 4.0+ pattern compliance maintained
- 4+/5 developer satisfaction

---

### Phase 4: Multi-Pattern Orchestration - Intelligence Layer
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks (after Phase 3 stable)

**What:** System understands pattern relationships, resolves dependencies, detects conflicts, and recommends optimal pattern combinations for features.

**Why:** Patterns don't exist in isolation. Features require multiple patterns working together. Manual pattern selection is error-prone and inconsistent.

**Business Value:**
- **Guided pattern selection** - "Use these patterns for this feature type"
- **Dependency resolution** - "CQRS requires Aggregates, adds Events automatically"
- **Conflict detection** - "Pattern X contradicts Pattern Y"
- **Implementation sequencing** - "Implement in this order: Phase 1 (Aggregates), Phase 2 (CQRS), Phase 3 (Projectors)"

**Key Features:**
- Pattern dependency graph (requires/recommends/conflicts)
- Cross-pattern integration validation
- Phase-based implementation planning
- Pattern gap analysis ("You have events but no projectors")

**Success Metrics:**
- Pattern recommendations 80%+ accurate
- Cross-pattern violations detected
- Implementation plans reduce errors by 40%
- Faster onboarding (new devs get expert guidance)

---

### Phase 5: Analytics & Continuous Improvement - Measurement
**Timeline:** Ongoing (parallel with Phase 3-4)

**What:** Track pattern adoption, quality trends, and ROI across team. Automated calibration refinement from real-world usage.

**Why:** Prove business value. Optimize patterns based on data, not intuition. Identify training needs and improvement opportunities.

**Business Value:**
- **ROI proof** - "Framework saved 240 hours per developer per year"
- **Quality trends** - "Pattern compliance improved from 3.2 to 4.3 in 6 months"
- **Pattern effectiveness** - "DDD Aggregates v2 reduced bugs by 30%"
- **Team insights** - "Junior devs produce senior-quality code with patterns"

**Key Features:**
- Pattern adoption dashboard
- Quality score trends over time
- Time savings metrics
- Bug correlation analysis
- Auto-calibration from feedback
- PR comment bot with scores

**Success Metrics:**
- Metrics tracked from day 1
- Dashboard showing ROI
- Pattern effectiveness measured
- Continuous calibration improvement
