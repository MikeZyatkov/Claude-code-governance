pattern_name: "Projectors and Read Models"
version: "v1"
domain: "CQRS and Event-Driven Architecture"

goal: |
  Transform domain events into optimized read models for query operations.
  Maintain eventual consistency between write model (aggregates) and read
  model (projections). Enable efficient queries without loading entire
  aggregates or traversing event streams.

guiding_policy: |
  Projectors subscribe to domain events and update read models (database tables)
  that are optimized for queries. Each projector handles events for one aggregate
  type. Projectors live in the application layer and use ports (interfaces) to
  write to infrastructure. Use dependency injection and handle events through a
  consistent handle() method pattern.
