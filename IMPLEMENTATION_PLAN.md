# Implementation Plan

**Objective:** Transform the governance framework from evaluation-only to autonomous implementation with self-correction, distributed via Claude Code plugins.

**Timeline:** 5-7 weeks to MVP, 12 weeks to full deployment

**Approach:** Benchmarks → Plugins → Real-world refinement

---

## Overview

### The Vision

Developers create implementation plans with AI, approve them, and let autonomous agents execute all tasks with pattern enforcement and self-correction. Developers only review once at the end, freeing 75-90 minutes per feature for deep work.

### Implementation Sequence

```
Phase 1: Benchmarks (1-2 weeks)
  ↓ Build confidence in evaluation accuracy
  ↓
Phase 2: Plugin Foundation (2-3 weeks)
  ↓ Package as Claude Code plugin
  ↓ Enable autonomous workflows via hooks
  ↓
Phase 3: Real-World Testing (2-3 weeks)
  ↓ Pilot with team
  ↓ Discover edge cases
  ↓
Phase 4: Refinement & Rollout (ongoing)
  ↓ Add edge cases to benchmarks
  ↓ Improve calibrations
  ↓ Scale to full team
```

**Why this order?**
- Benchmarks validate evaluation before building autonomous features
- Plugins rely on accurate evaluation for auto-correction
- Real-world usage feeds back into benchmarks
- Creates virtuous improvement cycle

---

## Phase 1: Benchmarks (Weeks 1-2)

### Goal
Validate evaluation framework accuracy with comprehensive test fixtures.

### Why First?
- Can't trust autonomous correction without accurate evaluation
- Benchmarks prove patterns score correctly
- Fast feedback loop for calibration changes (30 seconds vs weeks)
- Foundation for all future work

### Week 1: Migrate & Expand

**Day 1-2: Migrate Tests to Benchmarks**

Tasks:
- [ ] Create `benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/fixtures/{excellent,poor}` structure
- [ ] Move `evaluation/src/__tests__/fixtures/domain/happy-path/` → `benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/fixtures/excellent/`
- [ ] Move `evaluation/src/__tests__/fixtures/domain/regression/` → `benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/fixtures/poor/`
- [ ] Move `evaluation/src/__tests__/evaluation-with-plan.test.ts` → `benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/run.test.ts`
- [ ] Update imports in `run.test.ts` (from `../index` to `../../evaluation/src/index`)
- [ ] Update `package.json` scripts (add `benchmark:ddd`, `benchmark:all`, `benchmark:compare`)
- [ ] Remove old `evaluation/src/__tests__/fixtures/` directory

Commands:
```bash
mkdir -p benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/fixtures/{excellent,poor}
mv evaluation/src/__tests__/fixtures/domain/happy-path/* benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/fixtures/excellent/
mv evaluation/src/__tests__/fixtures/domain/regression/* benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/fixtures/poor/
mv evaluation/src/__tests__/fixtures/implementation-plan.md benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/
mv evaluation/src/__tests__/evaluation-with-plan.test.ts benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/run.test.ts
rm -rf evaluation/src/__tests__/fixtures
```

Time: 30 minutes

**Day 3-4: Add Coverage**

Tasks:
- [ ] Create "good" fixture (4.0-4.5 score): minor issues but acceptable
- [ ] Create "acceptable" fixture (3.8-4.2 score): at threshold
- [ ] Create 1-2 more "poor" fixtures (different failure modes)
- [ ] Document expected scores in `benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/fixtures/README.md`
- [ ] Add test cases for new fixtures in `run.test.ts`

Example fixtures to create:
- `good/User-minor-validation-issues.aggregate.ts` (missing optional validation)
- `poor/User-no-events.aggregate.ts` (no event sourcing)
- `poor/User-public-setters.aggregate.ts` (encapsulation violation)

Time: 3-4 hours

**Day 5: Baseline Tracking**

Tasks:
- [ ] Add baseline tracking to `run.test.ts` (beforeAll/afterAll hooks)
- [ ] Create `benchmarks/ddd-aggregates/baseline.json`
- [ ] Add regression detection logic (warn if score drops > 0.3)
- [ ] Test: run benchmarks twice, verify baseline saves

Code snippet:
```typescript
// Save results after each test
afterAll(() => {
  const baseline = {
    version: 'v1.0',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    results: currentResults
  }
  fs.writeFileSync('baseline.json', JSON.stringify(baseline, null, 2))
})

2. Hook intercepts → Loads DDD Aggregates pattern
3. Injects: goal, tactics, constraints, examples
4. Enhanced prompt → Claude generates with pattern awareness
```

Time: 4-6 hours

Reference: `docs/distribution.md` - Hook 1 section

**Day 3-4: Evaluation Hook**

Tasks:

- [ ] Format results for display (score, violations, recommendations)
- [ ] Append evaluation to tool result
- [ ] Test hook: verify scores appear after code generation

Hook flow:
```javascript
1. Claude writes code
2. Hook intercepts → Evaluates code
3. Appends pattern score (4.2/5.0)
4. Shows violations and recommendations
5. User sees evaluation immediately
```

Time: 4-6 hours

Reference: `docs/distribution.md` - Hook 2 section

**Day 5: Integration Testing**

Tasks:
- [ ] Test full flow: pattern injection → generation → evaluation
- [ ] Verify patterns are injected before generation

- [ ] Trigger only if score < threshold (e.g., 4.0)
- [ ] Generate correction plan from evaluation results
- [ ] Apply corrections iteratively (max 3 attempts)
- [ ] Re-evaluate after each correction
- [ ] Update file if successful, escalate if fails

Hook flow:
```javascript
1. Code generated, evaluated → Score 3.5
2. Hook triggers → "Score below 4.0, fixing..."
3. Analyze issues → Generate fixes
4. Apply fixes → Re-evaluate
5. Repeat until score ≥ 4.0 or max attempts
6. Report: "Auto-corrected in 2 attempts, new score: 4.3"
```

Time: 8-10 hours

Reference: `docs/distribution.md` - Hook 3 section

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk: Evaluation accuracy issues**
- Mitigation: Benchmarks validate before plugin deployment
- Fallback: Disable auto-correction, keep evaluation-only

**Risk: Auto-correction breaks code**
- Mitigation: Max 3 attempts, escalate to human
- Fallback: Manual review always required

**Risk: LLM inconsistency**
- Mitigation: Multi-pass evaluation, calibration rubrics
- Fallback: Use deterministic checks as guardrails

### Adoption Risks

**Risk: Developers don't trust autonomous agent**
- Mitigation: Start with evaluation-only, add auto-correction later
- Fallback: Make auto-correction opt-in per developer

**Risk: Pattern violations not caught**
- Mitigation: Comprehensive benchmarks, continuous refinement
- Fallback: Keep manual code review for critical code

**Risk: Too many false positives**
- Mitigation: Tune calibrations based on feedback
- Fallback: Adjust thresholds (e.g., 3.5 instead of 4.0)

### Timeline Risks

**Risk: Phase takes longer than estimated**
- Mitigation: Start simple, expand incrementally
- Fallback: Ship minimal version, iterate in production

**Risk: Team capacity constraints**
- Mitigation: One developer can drive this (you!)
- Fallback: Extend timeline, focus on highest value first
